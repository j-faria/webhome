*Olá!* 
I'm João, an astrophysicist sailing the turbulent waters of academia.  
I'm a researcher at the 
[Department of Astronomy of the University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/sciences/astro). 
<!-- {: style="text-align: center"} -->


I work on the detection of exoplanets, 
mostly using the radial-velocity (RV) method.  
More on that [here]({{site.baseurl}}/research).  

<!-- During my PhD, I was in charge of an RV survey of metal-poor stars, 
trying to estimate the occurrence rate of low-mass planets 
around low metallicity stars.  
I found a planet occurrence rate smaller than that of solar-metallicity stars, 
which means that the famous giant planet - metallicity correlation
extends to the population of low-mass planets. -->

When I'm not doing research, I like teaching, 
pretending I know how to design things (like this page), 
I'm a recovering perfectionist, and a bit of a computer geek.

Check out the links above for my CV and blog, the _academic_.
